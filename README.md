# Exploratory Data Analysis: Climate Change and Natural Disasters up to 2015

This analysis explores the relationship between climate change, as indicated by global temperature rise, and natural disasters. Python is the chosen tool, and the Jupyter Notebook "EDA of climate change and natural disasters.ipynb" details the analysis. Data sources include:

**Global Temperature Data:** Kaggle dataset from Berkeley Earth (https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data)


 **Natural Disaster Data:** Our World in Data (https://ourworldindata.org/natural-disasters) sourced from EMDAT (2019): OFDA/CRED International Disaster Database (Universit√© catholique de Louvain - Brussels - Belgium)

 
### Key Findings:

**Global Warming:** Analysis reveals a steady increase in global temperature since the 1920s.

**Natural Disasters:** A strong positive correlation exists between global temperature rise and the occurrence of natural disasters worldwide.

**Economic Impact:** The link between global warming and economic damage from natural disasters appears weaker, likely due to the influence of other factors.

I will next focus on a Dataset from 2015 - 2024 to show how the Earth has heated up in the past decade
