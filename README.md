### In this world of ever-increasing global temperatures and what seems like a natural disaster somewhere in the world every other day, I wanted to conduct a deeper dive into these and see if they are in anyay correlated - do rising temperatures equate to more natural disaster???? 
## Let's find out!
This analysis explores the relationship between climate change, as indicated by global temperature rise, and natural disasters. I will be using Python, specifically Pandas for my analysis which can be found in the file - **temperature_disaster.ipynb**

**Data sources include:**

**Global Temperature Data:** Kaggle dataset from Berkeley Earth (https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data)


 **Natural Disaster Data:** Our World in Data (https://ourworldindata.org/natural-disasters) sourced from EMDAT (2019): OFDA/CRED International Disaster Database (Universit√© catholique de Louvain - Brussels - Belgium)

 
### Key Findings:

**Global Warming:** Analysis reveals a steady increase in global temperature since the 1920s.

**Natural Disasters:** A strong positive correlation exists between global temperature rise and the occurrence of natural disasters worldwide.

**Economic Impact:** The link between global warming and economic damage from natural disasters appears weaker, likely due to the influence of other factors.

I will next focus on a Dataset from 2015 - 2024 to show how the Earth has heated up in the past decade
