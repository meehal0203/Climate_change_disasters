### In this world of ever-increasing global temperatures and what seems like a natural disaster somewhere in the world every other day, I wanted to conduct a deeper dive into these and see if they are in anyay correlated - do rising temperatures equate to more natural disaster???? 
## Let's find out!
This analysis explores the relationship between climate change, as indicated by global temperature rise, and natural disasters. I will be using Python, specifically Pandas for my analysis which can be found in the file - **temperature_disaster.ipynb**

**Data sources include:**

**Global Temperature Data:** Kaggle dataset from Berkeley Earth (https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data)


 **Natural Disaster Data:** Our World in Data (https://ourworldindata.org/natural-disasters) sourced from EMDAT (2019): OFDA/CRED International Disaster Database (Université catholique de Louvain - Brussels - Belgium)

 
### Key Findings:

**Global Warming:** Analysis reveals a steady increase in global temperature since the 1920s.

**Natural Disasters:** A strong positive correlation exists between global temperature rise and the occurrence of natural disasters worldwide.

**Economic Impact:** The link between global warming and economic damage from natural disasters appears weaker, likely due to the influence of other factors.

The heatmap and correlation analysis provide robust evidence supporting the hypothesis that global temperature rise is significantly correlated with an increase in most natural disaster occurrences

The discrepancy in the correlation with economic damage is an interesting observation. It suggests that while the frequency of disasters is influenced by climate change, the economic impact is likely influenced by a complex interplay of factors beyond just climate, such as technological advancements, economic growth, and disaster preparedness

I will next focus on a Dataset from 2015 - 2024 to show how the Earth has heated up in the past decade
